# SortItOut
Brief Introduction

This project is digits sorting game. This game name is “Sort It Out”. In our game, there is 4x4 matrix. The matrix consists of 15 digits from 1 to 15 arranged randomly. We did not add 16 numbers because one space is left empty for moving and swapping the digits. The player has to arrange the digits in ascending order from 1 to 4 in 1st row, 5 to 8 in 2nd row, 9 to 12 in 3rd row and 13 to 15 in 4th row using keys from keyboard. If the player sort all the 15 digits in ascending order, he/she will win otherwise lose. The player cannot move the digits diagonally. There are three difficulty levels in our game; easy, medium and hard. In easy level, there are 400 moves. In medium level, there are 300 moves. And in hard level, there are 200 moves. The player will have to sort all the digits within given moves, otherwise he/she will lose. We have also added graphics in our game.
