# README for "Sort It Out" Game

## Introduction

"Sort It Out" is a digits sorting game based on a 4x4 matrix. The matrix consists of 15 digits, from 1 to 15, arranged randomly with one empty space for moving and swapping digits. The player has to arrange the digits in ascending order, with a limited number of moves based on the selected difficulty level. The game includes easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels with 400, 300, and 200 moves, respectively.
